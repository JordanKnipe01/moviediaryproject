This is a project that implements TMDB API.
This is a pull request from https://github.com/trananhtuat/react-movie 

I have re-implemented this project as a personal project to develop my FERN full-stack skills.

This is still a work in progress - I have implemented a firebase database for this project and a fully functional login, signup, lost password system using firebase auth.

Further more I have just integrated real-time server access using firebase. 
You are now able to add movies to a user specific database.
